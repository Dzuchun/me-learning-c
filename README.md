# What's this?

I try to learn C, alright? To do that, I decided to go through [The C programming Language][book] 2nd edition published in 1988.

Why is it this book exatly? Idk, it's just whatever seemed alright in the search :idk:

I aknowledge, that 240 pages is not nearly enough to master C. So I'll probably keep learning after I finish this book (also might want to check something dating less than 40 years :3 )

These are my first-ever C programs. I like to save stuff like that, to clearly see my progress in the subject.
